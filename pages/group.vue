            Health Insurance removes the barriers to care when someone gets sick
            or injured. Health insurance provides financial protection against
            significant and unexpected health care costs. Overall, comprehensive
            health insurance provides peace of mind to individuals and families
            that they can get the medical help they need when they are sick.
