Our agents can advise you on the exact types of insurance you should consider purchasing. </p><a href="https://app.boldpenguin.com/start/hclife" target="_blank" class="p-button mb-6"> Request More Information </a><h3 class="mb-4">Products we offer:</h3><ul class="mb-4"><li>Business Owners Plan</li><li>General liability insurance</li><li>Flood</li><li>Cyber Liability</li><li>Workers Compensation</li><li>Errors and Omissions</li></ul></div></div></section><section class="p-4"><h4 class="mb-2">General Liability Insurance</h4><p class="mb-4"> Business owners can and should purchase general liability insurance to cover legal hassles due to accident, injuries and claims of negligence. These policies protect against payment due to the injured party as a result of bodily injury, property damage, medical expenses, libel, slander, the cost of defending lawsuits, and settlement bonds or judgments required during an appeal procedure. Ask an agent at Alliance West Insurance, Inc. about these coverages. </p><h4 class="mb-2">Professional Liability Insurance</h4><p> Business owners providing services should consider having professional liability insurance (also known as errors and omissions insurance). This type of liability coverage protects your business against malpractice, errors, and negligence in provision of services to your customers. Depending on your profession, you may be required by your state government to carry such a policy. For example, physicians are required to purchase malpractice insurance as a condition of practicing in certain states. </p></section>',3);function b(f,v){const n=r,a=c,i=o;return u(),t("div",g,[e(i,{lang:"en"},{default:s(()=>[e(a,null,{default:s(()=>[e(n,null,{default:s(()=>[d("Harcorp Life LLC | Business Insurance")]),_:1})]),_:1})]),_:1}),y])}const x=p(h,[["render",b]]);export{x as default};
