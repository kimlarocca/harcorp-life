Like the risk, the cost and amount of coverage of policies can vary among insurers just as much. Alliance West Insurance, Inc. can shop multiple companies to save you time and money. You should discuss your specific business risks and the types of insurance available with one of our licensed insurance agents. Our agents can advise you on the exact types of insurance you should consider purchasing. </p><h4 class="mb-4">Products we offer:</h4><ul class="mb-4"><li>Business Owners Plan</li><li>General liability insurance</li><li>Flood</li><li>Cyber Liability</li><li>Workers Compensation</li><li>Errors and Omissions</li></ul><h4 class="mb-2">General Liability Insurance</h4><p class="mb-4"> Business owners can and should purchase general liability insurance to cover legal hassles due to accident, injuries and claims of negligence. These policies protect against payment due to the injured party as a result of bodily injury, property damage, medical expenses, libel, slander, the cost of defending lawsuits, and settlement bonds or judgments required during an appeal procedure. Ask an agent at Alliance West Insurance, Inc. about these coverages. </p><h4 class="mb-2">Professional Liability Insurance</h4><p class="mb-4"> Business owners providing services should consider having professional liability insurance (also known as errors and omissions insurance). This type of liability coverage protects your business against malpractice, errors, and negligence in provision of services to your customers. Depending on your profession, you may be required by your state government to carry such a policy. For example, physicians are required to purchase malpractice insurance as a condition of practicing in certain states. </p></div><div class="col-12 lg:col mb-4"><img alt="woman signing work documents on a desk" src="'+d+'"></div></div></section><section class="mb-4"><div class="grid"><div class="col-12 lg:col mb-4"><img alt="woman signing work documents on a desk" src="'+p+'"></div><div class="col-12 lg:col-7 p-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mb-4">Group Benefits</h2><p class="mb-4"> Health Insurance removes the barriers to care when someone gets sick or injured.
